      <p>
        Seasonal influenza can be prevented by taking a few important steps.
        Here are some tips to help protect yourself and your community:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Get Vaccinated:</strong> The flu vaccine is the best defense
          against seasonal flu. Consult your healthcare provider about getting
          vaccinated annually.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Practice Good Hygiene:</strong> Wash your hands frequently
          with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid Close Contact:</strong> Stay away from people who are
          sick, and if you are sick, keep your distance from others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cover Your Coughs and Sneezes:</strong> Use a tissue or your
          elbow to cover your mouth and nose.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay Home:</strong> If you feel unwell, avoid going to work or
          school to prevent spreading the virus.
        </li>
      </ul>
